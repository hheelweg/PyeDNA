*credits: Maria A. Castellanos*

Future high-throughput platform for creating DNA/chromophore structures, performing all-atom MD and analyzing trajectories with classical and quantum methods.
Currenty has the following functions implemented:

- Create double stranded DNA helix (`double_helix`) with [NAB](https://github.com/Amber-MD/AmberClassic.git)
- Attach dye molecules (currently only `CY3`, `CY5`) in desired orientation
- Run all-atom AMBER MD on the DNA/dye composite with GPU support
- Analyze trajectories classicaly and quantum-mechanically (DFT/TDDFT) with `pyscf` and `gpu4pyscf`

ðŸš§ Future versions will include:
- Creation of more complex DNA structure
- Modules for construct dye input structures from ChemDraw (`.cdx`) files
- More functionality to analyze trajectories classically
- More functionality to analyze trajectories quantum-mechanically
- Extension to perform high-troughput analysis for optoelectronic properties 
- ...

Stay tuned for more ðŸš¨
