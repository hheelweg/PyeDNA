Future high-throughput platform for creating DNA/chromophore structures, performing all-atom MD and analyzing trajectories with classical and quantum methods.
Currenty has the folling functions implemented:

- Create double stranded DNA helix (`double_helix`)
- Attach dye molecules (currently only `CY3`, `CY5`) in desired orientation
- Run AMBER MD on the DNA/dye composite
- Analyze trajectories classicaly and quantum-mechanically (DFT/TDDFT)

Future versions will include:
- add
